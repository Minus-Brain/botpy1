			Plans for a new KQ Entertainment boy band began after a staff member discovered a letter and sample mixtape from Kim Hongjoong, who would eventually become Ateez's leader, expressing interest in becoming a trainee at the company due to his admiration of Block B, a group also managed by KQ Entertainment. Hongjoong became the company's first official trainee and would remain the only one until Yunho joined six months later. Over the next year, members Mingi, San, Seonghwa, Yeosang, Jongho, and Wooyoung joined KQ Entertainment as trainees. Many had previous training experience at other companies: Mingi at Maroo Entertainment, Jongho at TOP Media, and Yeosang and Wooyoung at Big Hit Entertainment.13 They were known as "KQ Fellaz" prior to debuting.14
